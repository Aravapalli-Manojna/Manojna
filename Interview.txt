1. Periodontitis :

"Periodontitis is a serious gum disease that, if not treated early, can lead to tooth loss and even affect heart health. To help with early detection, I developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can identify and classify periodontitis into three stages: mild, moderate, and severe. I used a Kaggle dataset containing 3995 dental X-ray images, which were labeled and split into training, validation, and test sets. Each class was almost evenly distributed to avoid bias. I preprocessed the images by resizing, normalizing, and applying data augmentation to improve generalization. The CNN model was built using TensorFlow and Keras, and I achieved 86% accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters and training with proper validation. The model was evaluated using accuracy, and I also reviewed class-wise performance to ensure balance. This project not only automates a traditionally manual diagnosis process but also supports faster and more accurate dental screening. I believe the accuracy can be improved further using transfer learning or ensemble methods."


2. Fuel Analysis :

"In this project, I designed a smart fuel monitoring system to prevent fuel fraud during vehicle refueling. The core of the system is a turbine flow sensor that accurately measures the amount of fuel being filled based on the number of pulses generated by the rotating turbine as fuel flows through. I used an Arduino to read the pulse signals and calculate the real-time flow rate and total volume, which is displayed on a screen for the user. The goal was to give users clear, tamper-proof information about how much fuel they actually receive compared to what they paid for. I calibrated the sensor using standard volume tests to ensure over 90% accuracy and handled challenges like signal noise and power stability. This system helps users make informed decisions and is particularly useful for logistics companies or fleet vehicles. The innovation and real-world relevance of this project led to it being selected as a finalist in the WE HUB Foundation’s Cohort 3, which validated its impact and feasibility."


3. Earthquake Forecasting :


"In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict the epicenters of future earthquakes using real-time seismic data from the USGS Earthquake Catalog. The dataset had over 10,000 records with features like magnitude, depth, time, and location. We used Python with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and seaborn. For prediction, we built three regression models: Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and a Stacking Regressor that combined both. The goal was to predict the latitude and longitude of future earthquake locations. We split the data using an 80-20 ratio, scaled it, and selected relevant features like magnitude, depth, and timestamp. Our stacking model gave the best performance with an R² score of 0.92, close to Random Forest’s 0.93 but more stable overall. Visualizations showed predicted epicenters mapped globally. This model can help governments and agencies improve early warning systems, disaster preparedness, and reduce human and economic loss."

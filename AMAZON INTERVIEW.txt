PROJECTS :


Periodontitis : 

 1. What is periodontitis and why is this problem important?
Periodontitis is a progressive gum disease that leads to the loss of alveolar bone and teeth, and can impair chewing function, impacting nutritional intake. It's the sixth most prevalent disease globally, and if untreated, can lead to tooth loss and potentially heart-related complications due to nerve connection pathways.

This problem is important because:

Traditional diagnosis relies on manual interpretation of X-rays, which is subjective and error-prone.

Automating this with deep learning allows for early, accurate, and scalable diagnosis.

It improves clinical decision-making and helps in tailoring treatment based on disease severity.

üîπ 2. Explain your CNN architecture.
The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify X-ray images into three stages of periodontitis: mild, moderate, and severe. Though the exact architecture layers are not detailed in the paper, a typical structure used would involve:

Input Layer to process grayscale dental X-ray images.

Multiple convolutional layers to extract local features (like bone loss patterns).

ReLU activation for non-linearity.

Max-pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.

Fully connected layers to perform the final classification.

Softmax layer with 3 outputs corresponding to the severity stages.

The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

üîπ 3. What preprocessing did you do on the dataset?
While the paper doesn‚Äôt list specific preprocessing steps, standard and expected steps include:

Grayscale normalization of X-ray images.

Resizing all images to a consistent dimension (commonly 224x224 or 256x256).

Label encoding of the three stages: mild, moderate, severe.

Data augmentation (e.g., rotation, zooming, flipping) to increase dataset variability and reduce overfitting.

Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

üîπ 4. What was your dataset size and class distribution?
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, named "Periapical Periodontitis" dataset.

Training set: 3000 images

1000 mild

1000 moderate

1000 severe

Validation set: 665 images

200 mild

240 moderate

225 severe

Test set: 330 images

90 mild

130 moderate

110 severe

Total: 3995 labeled X-ray images, fairly balanced across classes.

üîπ 5. How did you achieve 86% accuracy? Could you improve it?
Achieved 86% accuracy by:

Using a well-designed CNN model trained on labeled X-ray images.

Ensuring a balanced dataset across all severity stages.

Utilizing appropriate image preprocessing and augmentation.

Training with optimal hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

Validating the model‚Äôs performance using a distinct validation set to prevent overfitting.

To improve it further, we could:

Use pretrained models like ResNet or VGG (transfer learning).

Apply more advanced data augmentation techniques.

Tune hyperparameters with Bayesian optimization or Grid Search.

Introduce attention mechanisms to focus on critical image regions.

Use ensemble models for more robust predictions.

üîπ 6. Evaluation metrics used?
While accuracy is the primary metric mentioned (86%), typically for a multi-class classification problem like this, the following metrics would be used:

Accuracy: Overall correct predictions.

Precision, Recall, F1-Score (per class): To measure balance and performance for each stage.

Confusion Matrix: To identify where the model confuses between stages.

AUC-ROC (if applicable): For overall model discriminative ability.


2. Fuel Analysis : 

Fuel fraud is a common problem in both private and commercial transport. During fuel filling, people often receive less fuel than paid for, but most drivers or vehicle owners have no way of accurately measuring it. Traditional fuel gauges are not precise and don't detect manipulation.

üéØ Objective:
To build a real-time, low-cost system that:

Accurately measures fuel quantity during refills

Detects fuel fraud or theft

Tracks fuel usage patterns

Helps users make informed decisions

üß† Concept & Approach:
We used a Turbine Flow Sensor (YF-S201) to measure how much fuel is passing through a pipeline. The sensor generates a pulse signal every time the turbine inside it spins (due to liquid flow). The number of pulses correlates to the volume of fuel passing through.

Flow rate formula:

Edit
Flow Rate (L/min) = (Pulse frequency / Calibration constant)
‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture:
Hardware Components:

Turbine Flow Sensor (YF-S201) ‚Äì Measures fuel flow

Arduino Uno ‚Äì Reads pulse data from the sensor

LCD Display / Serial Monitor ‚Äì Shows real-time flow and total fuel filled

Power Supply ‚Äì For the sensor and controller

Optional: GSM/IoT Module ‚Äì For real-time alerts or cloud monitoring (extendable)

Software Tools:

Arduino IDE ‚Äì For coding and uploading the firmware

Embedded C / Arduino C ‚Äì Programming language used

Serial Plotter ‚Äì To visualize flow rate

Excel / Google Sheets ‚Äì To analyze trends from saved data

üîÑ Workflow:
When fuel starts flowing, the sensor generates digital pulses.

Arduino counts pulses per second ‚Üí calculates flow rate and total volume.

The display shows live liters filled.

After filling, it compares against amount paid ‚Üí if there‚Äôs a mismatch, it alerts the user.

üí° Key Features:
Real-time measurement

High accuracy (calibrated using standard volume test)

Tamper detection (if flow cuts off suddenly or pulse frequency is abnormal)

User-friendly display

Extensible to cloud or mobile apps for vehicle fleet management

üìä Challenges Faced:
Sensor Calibration: Initially, readings were inconsistent. We tested it against known volumes to calibrate it.

Fuel viscosity: Different fuels (diesel vs petrol) affected the turbine differently. We accounted for this by adjusting constants.

Noise in signals: Used debouncing techniques to reduce false readings.

Power issues: Ensured stable power supply for clean pulse generation.

üìà Results & Recognition:
Achieved accurate real-time monitoring with over 90% precision.

Helped users identify fuel delivery discrepancies.

Selected as a finalist in WE HUB Foundation‚Äôs Cohort 3, validating the real-world impact and innovation of the project.

üîÑ Scope for Improvement:
Add IoT/Cloud integration to remotely monitor fuel logs

Connect to mobile apps for notifications and analytics

Use machine learning to detect fuel theft patterns over time

Replace Arduino with ESP32 for WiFi-enabled operations

‚úÖ Summary for Interview:
"This project is a smart fuel-tracking system that uses a turbine flow sensor and Arduino to measure the exact amount of fuel filled into a vehicle. It addresses real-world issues like fuel fraud and inaccurate refilling by giving live, accurate volume data. We calibrated the system to achieve high accuracy, handled sensor noise, and validated the concept in a live environment. It was also recognized by WE HUB Foundation. The system is designed to be scalable and can be extended into fleet management or logistics systems with IoT features."
